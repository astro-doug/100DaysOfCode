# 100DaysOfCode
Udemy 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Bootcamp

Each "Day" has a final project, and these are my submissions for those projects.

While the code is not necessarily written to be the simplest, or most efficient, each day's assignment is 
written using only what has been taught in the class to that point. For some, I have gone back later and refactored
the code in a sister file.
